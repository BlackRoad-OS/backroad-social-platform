# BackRoad Social Platform - Manifesto

**"Depth Over Engagement. Meaning Over Metrics."**

## The Problem with Social Media

Modern social media is broken:
- ❌ **Vanity metrics** (likes, followers, views) drive anxiety and addiction
- ❌ **Algorithmic feeds** optimize for outrage, not connection
- ❌ **Infinite scroll** wastes time and destroys focus
- ❌ **Public performance** replaces authentic conversation
- ❌ **Surveillance capitalism** monetizes your data and attention

## The BackRoad Way

We're building something different:

### Core Principles

1. **No Vanity Metrics**
   - No like counts
   - No follower counts
   - No public view metrics
   - No "trending" or "viral" feeds

2. **Meaningful Connections**
   - Deep conversations, not hot takes
   - Knowledge sharing, not performative posting
   - Private threads, not public broadcasts
   - Quality over quantity

3. **User Respect**
   - No algorithmic manipulation
   - No dark patterns
   - No data selling
   - No attention hijacking
   - Chronological feeds always

4. **Depth Metrics That Matter**
   - **Conversation depth** - How many meaningful exchanges?
   - **Knowledge shared** - Did you teach/learn something?
   - **Connection quality** - Do you *actually* talk to your connections?
   - **Time well spent** - Did you leave enriched, not drained?

### Features

#### For Individuals

- **Knowledge Base** - Build your personal wiki as you learn

- **Mentorship** - Connect learners and experts

#### For Communities
- **Topic Spaces** - Focused discussion areas
- **Resource Libraries** - Curated knowledge repositories

- **Governance** - Community-driven moderation

#### What's Missing (On Purpose)
- ❌ Public like/follower counts
- ❌ Infinite scroll

- ❌ Viral mechanics
- ❌ "Engagement" optimization

### Why BackRoad?

**The name "BackRoad" means taking the slower, more scenic route.**

Instead of racing down the algorithmic highway (optimized for speed/engagement), we take the back roads - slower, more intentional, more meaningful.

You might not "grow" as fast. You might not "go viral." But you'll:
- Build real relationships
- Learn deeply
- Create meaningful work
- Maintain your sanity
- Own your data

### Success Metrics

We measure success by:
- **Quality of conversations** (self-reported depth)
- **Knowledge created** (wiki pages, resources shared)
- **Time well spent** (users feel enriched, not drained)
- **Real-world impact** (projects launched, connections made)
- **Retention** (people stay because it's valuable, not addictive)

NOT by:
- ❌ Daily active users
- ❌ Time on site
- ❌ Posts per day
- ❌ Viral content
- ❌ Engagement metrics

### Join Us

If you're tired of:
- Doomscrolling
- Performative posting
- Anxiety from metrics
- Algorithmic manipulation
- Time wasted

**Welcome to BackRoad.**

Take the scenic route. Have real conversations. Build something meaningful.
